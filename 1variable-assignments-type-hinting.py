#explain part

# var_1 = 10

# var_1 is assigned the integer value 10.
# var_1 = 30.7

# var_1 is reassigned with the float value 30.7. This demonstrates that Python is dynamically typed, meaning a variable's type can change during its lifetime.
# var_2 = 10.5

# var_2 is assigned the float value 10.5.
# var_3 = 10 + 10j

# var_3 is assigned a complex number with a real part (10) and an imaginary part (10j).
# name = "Flavian"

# name is assigned the string value "damiano."
# var_5 = True

# var_5 is assigned the boolean value True. The comment suggests that it could also be assigned False, which is another boolean value.
# var_6 = None

# var_6 is assigned the special value None, which represents the absence of a value or a null value in Python.
# VAR_6 = "hello"

# VAR_6 is assigned the string value "hello." It's important to note that variable names in Python are case-sensitive, so VAR_6 and var_6 are different variables.
# a: int = 10

# This line uses type hinting to specify that the variable a should be of type int. It's assigned the integer value 10 in the next line.
# a = 10.5

# a is reassigned with the float value 10.5. This demonstrates that even with type hinting, Python still allows dynamic type changes. However, type hinting is a way to indicate the intended type of a variable, but it's not enforced by the interpreter.
# Lastly, there are commented-out print statements, which, when uncommented and executed, would print the values of the variables. These statements are useful for checking the current values of the variables during program execution.
