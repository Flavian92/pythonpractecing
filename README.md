Open a Terminal:
You can open a terminal in Ubuntu by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T or by searching for "Terminal" in the application menu.

Navigate to the Script's Directory:
Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example, if your script is in the "Documents" directory, you can navigate there like this:

bash
Copy code
cd ~/Documents
Replace ~/Documents with the actual path to your script.

Run the Python Script:
To run the Python script, you can use the python command followed by the script's filename. For example, if your script is named "myscript.py," you can run it like this:

bash
Copy code
python myscript.py
If you're using Python 3, you can use python3 instead of python:

bash
Copy code
python3 myscript.py
Make sure that your Python script has the .py extension.

Executable Python Script (Optional):
If you want to make your Python script executable directly without specifying the python or python3 command, you can do the following:

Add a shebang line at the very beginning of your Python script, like this:

python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env python3
This line specifies the interpreter to use. In this case, it's set to use Python 3.

Make the script executable with the chmod command:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x myscript.py
You can then run the script directly:

bash
Copy code
./myscript.py
That's it! Your Python script should now execute in your Ubuntu terminal. Make sure your script is located in the directory where you're executing the python or python3 command, or provide the full path to the script if it's located elsewhere.


To execute single script and see the result u have to uncomment (#)
